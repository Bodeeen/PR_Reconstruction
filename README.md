# PR_Reconstruction

- This code is all under developement -

The files and code in this repository are used for reconstruction of parallellized RESOLFT data. 
It is based on the code supplied together with the paper:
'Nanoscopy with more than a hundred thousand "doughnuts"' by Andriy Chmyrov et al.,
that appeared in Nature Methods, 2013
with modifications and changes being added continuosly.

The following text is from the original distribution of the code supplied with the paper mentioned
above:

---
All Matlab code files in this folder are unsupported and not for production use!
We do not take responsibility for the completness of the code and results.

This algorithms are used for calculating the image data of a parallelized RESOLFT
microscope from raw camera frames. The period of the off switching pattern is also
calculated.

Refer to function combine_camera_frames() to see how we analyzed our camera data.

The data files itself are not provided. They would take several hundreds of MB space.
